## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- PostgreSQL database
- Anthropic API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/workflow-optimizer.git
   cd workflow-optimizer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
   SEARCH_API_KEY=your_search_api_key (optional)
   ```

4. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## üß™ Development & Testing

The application includes built-in developer tools for testing:

- **Developer Debug Panel**: Access by clicking the "Developer Tools" button in the bottom-right corner
- **Test Data Generation**: Create test chats with predefined BCBA hiring workflow
- **Phase Simulation**: Test different phases of the workflow process
- **API Endpoints**: Debug endpoints for testing specific functionality

## üìä System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with three main layers:

1. **Client Layer**: React-based single-page application
2. **Server Layer**: Node.js Express server with Claude AI integration
3. **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM

## üîÑ Workflow Process

1. **User creates a new chat**
2. **Phase 1: Workflow Discovery**
   - Claude conducts an interview about the user's workflow
   - AI extracts structured workflow data
3. **Phase 2: Diagram Generation**
   - System generates a Mermaid flowchart of the workflow
   - Claude converts the Mermaid syntax into a visual diagram
4. **Phase 3: AI Opportunity Suggestions**
   - Claude analyzes the workflow for optimization opportunities
   - Web search integration provides real-world best practices
   - Extended Thinking Mode enables deeper analysis

## üîê Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: API key for Claude AI integration (required)
- `SEARCH_API_KEY`: API key for web search functionality (optional)
- `SEARCH_ENGINE`: Search engine to use (default: 'serper', alternative: 'google')
- `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID`: Required if using Google search engine

## Ideal End State
1. Deployed app
2. Someone can start a new chat and work through the conversation phase, the diagram phase, and the diagnosis phase and get an AI output
3. You can easily test each of the stages using a set of testing buttons
   a. Dropdown set of phase selection elements
   b. Test chat button
4. The app can be easily edited by Chad on Lovable, Repit, etc.

## Missing Features
1. Debug Features
2. Deployment


## To do

### Debug Features
[] Update the debug pannel view
      Labeled "1. New Test Chat"
      On click:
      Calls the existing createTestChat() method
      Adds the new chat to the visible list of chats
      Opens the new chat in the main window
   3. Phase Selector ‚Äì Multi-Select Buttons
      Vertically stacked buttons labeled 1, 2, and 3 (for Phases 1‚Äì3)
      Each button acts as a toggle
      Can be multi-selected
      UI state: pressed = selected, default = unselected
      On click: update internal selectedPhases: number[] state
   4. "Test" Button Behavior
      Central button labeled "Test"
      On click:
      For each selectedPhase in selectedPhases, call setChatPhase(chatId, phaseX)
      Must only run if a current chat is selected
      Can optionally show a toast or visual confirmation for each phase triggered
   5. Integration & Visibility
      This new debug panel:
      Replaces the current Developer Debug Tools panel
      Is hidden by default
      Can be toggled on via a new toggle switch/button in the main UI
[] Update the debug pannel view
   [] Top Section ‚Äì Current Chat Display
   [] Primary Action ‚Äì "1. New Test Chat" Button
       [] New Chat Creates a new imediate chat with the first phase selected
   [] Phase Selector ‚Äì Multi-Select Buttons
       [] Move the phase selections to the left and have them be a 
   [] Test Button Behavior
       [] Once the phase is selected it should set the phase to test
[] Name the test chats with a test and number prefix and increment up with each of the same tests
[] Have a way to get the test chats ID from the chat window
